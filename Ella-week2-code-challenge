Week 2 Code Challenge:
Write a program that uses two buttons on the circuit playground bluefruit as inputs

When you push button A the lights should light up with ONE color
When you button button B the lights should light up with a SECOND color
When you push both buttons the lights should light up with a THIRD color

Use if and elif to make this happen:

if condition 1:
    code to execute
elif condition 2:
    code to execute
elif condition 3:
    code to execute
else:
    default code to execute

'''

while True:
    # gather all input values from sensors
    # print the value of our button_a object
    button_a_read = button_a.value
    print("button a read is:", button_a_read)

    # set variables based on the value of your inputs
    if button_a_read == True:
        led_state = True
    else:
        led_state = False

    # set outputs based on the value of my variables
    if led_state == True:
        # turn the neopixels ac_orange
        pixels.fill(ac_orange)
    else:
        pixels.fill(0)
        # turn the neopixels off

    time.sleep(0.1)
